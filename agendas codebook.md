# 1. Summary

The Research Project "Agenda-Setting in Switzerland" represents the Swiss contribution to the international ["Comparative Policy Agendas" project](http://www.comparativeagendas.org). In order to quantitatively assess the relative share of political attention to different policy issues, national teams systematically collect and code political objects in accordance to a topics codebook initially developed in the United States by the [Policy Agendas project](http://www.policyagendas.org) leaded by Frank Baumgartner and Bryan D. Jones. Largely based on the US classification scheme, the Swiss topics codebook incorporates a small number of national specificities to ultimately comprehend 20 main categories and more than 200 subcategories. 

This Swiss topics codebook includes a list of categories' names and codes, which have been mainly borrowed from the US codebook. To a lesser extent the topics codebooks developed by other national research teams have been consulted, in particular the [Danish](http://www.agendasetting.dk), [Spanish](http://www.ub.edu/spanishpolicyagendas), [French](http://www.agendas-france.fr) and Belgian  versions. Details regarding the modifications made in the Swiss version and how they relate to the US/Master codebook are included in the annex of this document under the title "CPA Master Codebook notes".

For **some** of the subcategories the examples provided by the original US codebook have been retained in this document **(when they are relevant in the Swiss context) but most of the** illustrations **originate in** the Swiss case.
